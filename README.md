### [Assignment 3: Sourcing Data, Summary Statistics, and Basic Data Visualization]( https://github.com/nyu-csci-ua-0479-001-fall-2023/homework03-ericemmendorfer  )
<details>
  <summary>Overview:</summary>
  Goals:
<li>source and document a dataset</li>
<li>use plain Python and built in modules to extract and transform data</li>
<li>work with numpy to calculate summary statistics</li>
<li>use matplotlib for simple data visualizations </li>
  <br>
Requirements
<li>1 x notebooks:  src/homework03.ipynb</li>
<li>1 x original data set:  data/raw/* </li>
  <br>
Overview: <br>
In this assignment, you'll create a single notebook, (ipynb) that contains documentation and code. There are 6 parts to this assignment:
  
  1. write some questions that may be answered by using summary statistics and / or creating visualizations
  
  2. select and document a data set
- ⚠️ the data should be comma / pipe / tab delimited…
- ⚠️ the data set should have at least one numeric column and one column that contains categorical data
- include documentation regarding the source of the data
- include the data set in your repository so that your notebooks can be run by the graders without having to perform any setup (if data set is > 100MB, link to file instead)

3. use "regular" python with built-in modules to create a data pipeline to extract or transform data
4. work with numpy or regular Python to calculate summary statistics
5. create at least two visualizations with matplotlib
6. write a conclusion answering your initial questions based on the summary statistics you calculated or visualizations you created
- describe the results of your calculations and visualizations
- describe whether or not they were able to answer your initial questions
